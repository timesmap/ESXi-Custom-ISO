# ☁️ Custom VMware ESXi ISO build scripts

### Inject consumer NIC, NVME & USB NIC drivers into ESXi ISO images.
- Each script will present a menu to select which patch level to build your new ISO.

### [esxi8.ps1](https://github.com/itiligent/ESXi-Custom-ISO/blob/main/esxi8.ps1) 
- Builds an ESXi 8.x iso with latest NVME & USB NIC Fling drivers + latest GhettoVCB backup. (The VMware Community NIC Fling was built in to 8.x, so no need to add this.)
	- _For earlier 800, 80U1 or 80U2 builds, see script notes to select the correct USB NIC Fling_

### [esxi7.ps1](https://github.com/itiligent/ESXi-Custom-ISO/blob/main/esxi7.ps1)
- Builds an ESXi 7.x iso with latest NVME, NIC & USB NIC Fling drivers + latest GhettoVCB backup.

### [esxi6.7.ps1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/itiligent/ESXi-Custom-ISO/main/esxi6.7.ps1) (Zimaboard compatible)
- Builds an ESXi 6.7 iso with latest NVME & USB NIC drivers, Zimaboard Realtek 1GbE NIC driver + latest GhettoVCB backup.


### 🛠️ Instructions for building ESXi ISOs:

1. Ensure your local Powershell script policy will allow you to run PS scripts.
````
Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope CurrentUser #(and select All)
To restore default policy: Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser 
````

2. (For ESXi 7 & 8 ISOs, skip this step) For 6.7 ISOs you must OFFLINE INSTALL **PowerCLI 12.7.0** using the method shown below. [Download it here](https://developer.vmware.com/web/tool/12.7.0/vmware-powercli/). After install, simply run the esxi6.7.ps1 script. ESXi 6.x ISOs DO NOT REQUIRE PYTHON INSTALLATION. 
```
# If a PowerCLI version later than 12.7.0 is already installed, remove this first with:
    Get-Module VMware.PowerCLI -ListAvailable).RequiredModules | Uninstall-Module -Force
# Next, extract all the contents of the PowerCLI zip (a bunch of VMware.xxx directories) and copy these into the below path.
    %ProgramFiles%\WindowsPowerShell\Modules 
# Unblock the new PowerCLI module files  
    Get-ChildItem -Path $env:PROGRAMFILES\WindowsPowerShell\Modules\ -Recurse | Unblock-File 
```

For ESXi 7.x and 8.x ISOs only, you must install the CURRENT version of VMware PowerCLI and Python > 3.7.1
```
Install-Module VMware.PowerCLI -Scope CurrentUser 
Select Y to install from untrusted repo.  Install might take a long while
```

 
3. To install Python 3.7.9 [download it here](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-379/) (3.7.9 is shown to be stable, some versions are more buggy):
```
Run the installer and check "Add Python to PATH" a the start of the install, and at the end of the install, select "Disable path length limit". 
```

4. Next upgrade Python PIP via Command prompt (assumes 64 bit):
```
C:\Users\%username%\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python37\python.exe -m pip install --upgrade pip
```

5. Add the extra Python dependencies for PowerCLI via Command prompt (assumes 64 bit):
```
C:\Users\%username%\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python37\Scripts\pip3.7.exe install six psutil lxml pyopenssl
```

6. Adjust the PowerCLI python.exe path and Customer Improvement Program settings (assumes 64 bit):
```
Set-PowerCLIConfiguration -Scope User -ParticipateInCEIP $false
Set-PowerCLIConfiguration -PythonPath C:\Users\$env:USERNAME\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python37\python.exe
```

7. **Now you can run the script to start creating your own custom ISO!**  🚀

- Zimaboard users note:
  - You may need to set full duplex on ESXi NIC & physical switch for better performance.
  - Zimaboard's optional RTL 8125 2.5GbE NIC driver for ESXi 6.7 can be found [here](https://github.com/itiligent/ESXi-Custom-ISO/raw/main/6.7-drivers/net-r8125-9.011.00-10.vib)
    - To manually install 2.5GbE driver:`esxcli software vib install -v net-r8125-9.011.00-10.vib`
    - To manually remove 2.5GbE driver: `esxcli software vib remove -n net-r8125`

The Community Flings appear to have been rolled into the Broadcom universe, but Flings now require a Broadcom user account to access. A copy of the original (archived) flings.vmware.com site can also be found at https://archive.org/details/flings.vmware.com.
